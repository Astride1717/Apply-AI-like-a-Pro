There is probably no sector or discipline, from agriculture and finance to humanities and autonomous driving, that has not used AI. Professionals with AI skills are highly sought-after; the US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts the demand to increase by 28% or 11.5 million new jobs through 2026, outpacing all other industries. One of AI’s undisputable advantages over most other technologies is its high transferability, significantly lowering industry-specific barriers to its applications.\\nThe Advanced Learning Certificate in Artificial Intelligence Applications for Health Data is designed for professionals interested in contemporary AI technologies and seeking to build skills with AI’s applications to health or other “big data” for their work or research. This program is designed to take you from an AI novice to a confident practitioner with integrated case studies and programming demonstrations using Google Colab. It will provide hands-on, step-by-step guidance, and ample real-world practice opportunities for professionals to learn and apply AI tools and models to solve real-world health and social problems.\\nProgram details and prerequisites are listed below.
